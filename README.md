## Conceptual Design of Conveyor
This is a conceptual modeling of a conveyor that is needed in a factory. A packaging machine that used to produce one size box is now upgraded to produce three sizes, 10x10x10, 20x20x20 and 30x30x30 cm boxes. A mechanism is needed to separate boxes by size. Only the mechanism was designed. The sensing method is not considered, rather it is discussed in another aspect.

In this Git, STL files of all parts are available. All models were made with self effort using AutoDisk Fusion 360 except one component, which was used as is from McMaster-Carr, [Link](https://www.mcmaster.com/). Lint to Fusion 360 [here](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview)
